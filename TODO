- todo: unit tests
- todo: publish module
- bug: if there are two tags for the same commit, 
      only one will be picked up by git describe, breaking the check
- bug: 
      fails on folder names that don't have an __init__.py. This is b.c. git does not save folders!
      I'm not sure if there is a solution?
      -> the regular git loader will find it anyway, this is odd...
- bug:
      duplicate tags will fail. Instead, we want to silently return the old one (the code will not have changed!)
- todo: git pipline
- todo: autocleanup after tests
- todo document how it works + flashback returning modules
