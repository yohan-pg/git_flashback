- use python git instead of bash, such that it works cross platform
- understand snapshot.sh
- make it a pip module

- Add exception caching to the snapshot.sh -> or even better, create a snapshot without running `add .`
- add a way of acessing the loaded modules from the git
- patch subclasscheck on reloaded classes... this might be a bit tricky. Maybe just add a decorator?
- prime snapshots instead of taking on the millisections
- migrate default to dill! but make sure to disable saving code. also use dill within torch.save
- add a way of marking labels for safekeeping (just rename the tag? or create a second one?)
  - add a way of clearing old cans. garbage collect on a folder? also ignore all tags for which another tag exists (so safekept tags arent replaced)
- verbose mode for deleted tags
- avoid heavy snapshots by imposing a 1mb file limit -> something
- fix loading failing for classes without a __init__ file...

- bug: if there are two tags for the same commit, only one will be pikced up by git describe, breaking the check

- test: autocleanup
- test: paths work when running from another directory
- test: optional file instead of filename string
- test: option to load from another commit 
- test: if the current commit matches the snapshot, just load modules from the working directory
- test: torch compatibiltiy
