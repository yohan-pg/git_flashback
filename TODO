- make it a pip module
- add padding to the header for future stuff?
  - read up on how PNG does padding and such
- make save/load methods on a snapshot! -> also, autocleanup
- add a way of executing a cleanup though the cli (-m flag or something)

- bug: if there are two tags for the same commit, 
      only one will be picked up by git describe, breaking the check

- test: renaming a tag to back it up
- test: accessing the loaded modules from the git
- test: isinstance, issubclass
- test: dill default
- test: make sure it works from another repo
- test: autocleanup
- test: paths work when running from another directory
- test: optional file instead of filename string
- test: option to load from another commit 
- test: if the current commit matches the snapshot, just load modules from the working directory
- test: torch compatibiltiy
- test: repo.index.add_all() reflects what the user adds manually to the index 
      (this will be tricky to test! maybe just do it manually)
